## Overview

This project is a web application integrated with Firebase. The initial setup resolves Firebase connection issues and establishes a basic project structure.

## Implemented Features

*   **Firebase Integration:**
    *   Initialized a new Firebase project (`productbulider-week1`).
    *   Created a web app within the Firebase project.
    *   Configured `index.html` to include the Firebase SDK and initialize it with the project's credentials.
*   **Basic HTML Structure:**
    *   A simple `index.html` file with a welcome message.

## Next Steps

The following steps will be taken to further develop the application:

1.  **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   Incorporate modern CSS for a visually appealing and responsive layout.
    *   Use Web Components to create reusable UI elements.
2.  **Feature Development:**
    *   Implement user authentication using Firebase Authentication.
    *   Utilize Firestore for data storage and retrieval.
3.  **Code Organization:**
    *   Structure JavaScript code using ES Modules (`import`/`export`).
    *   Create separate files for CSS (`style.css`) and JavaScript (`main.js`).
